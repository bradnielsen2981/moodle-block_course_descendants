moodle-block_course_descendants
===============================

Provides practical access to descendant courses of a metacourse

A descendant course (child) is a normal course from which the current course gets some of
his enrolments by propagation. 

The course descentants block gives in a block a fast link list to those courses, depending
if the current user has effective enrolment in it. 

When meta-courses are used as subparts of a training program, than this block used
in the meta-course allows a fast browse up to a surrounding enrolment course.
